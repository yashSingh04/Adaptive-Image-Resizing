## Adaptive Image Resizing
<p> The project focuses on seam carving, a content-aware image resizing technique that adjusts image dimensions by removing or inserting seams, preserving important content. It explains the implementation of seam carving using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and dynamic programming to find the minimum energy seams. Performance improvements were achieved by removing multiple seams simultaneously, reducing time complexity by 68%. The report also covers a deep learning-based seam carving approach using a VGG16-based UNet model and perceptual loss, showing promising results with a high structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.8186.<br><a href="2.
